## Why Python Dominates AI

Python is not fast — **ecosystems are fast**.

AI engineers choose Python because:
- libraries encode decades of research
- prototyping speed matters more than micro-optimizations
- production bottlenecks are elsewhere

## Variables and Types

```python
x = 10
y = 3.14
name = "AI"
```
